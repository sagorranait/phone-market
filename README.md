 ## Packages, I've used : 
 - axios
 - firebase
 - stripe/react-stripe-js
 - react-query
 - react-icons
 - react-bootstrap
 - react-router-dom
 - react-loader-spinner
 - and many more.

 ## Features
 - To make purchases of the product, PhoneMarket has adopted the Stripe payment system. Making payments is quite secure.
 - React Bootstrap is what I've chosen to utilize for the PhoneMarket UI. Because it was rewritten for React, it is now quite popular.
 - For the purpose of displaying error and success messages, I used React Hot Toast. It will help you fix any information you gave that was wrong.
 - When data has been loaded from the database and a user has logged in on the private route page, we reload the page. There will be an obvious loading spinner. React Loader Spinner has been removed for this.
 - I've used React Router Dom for multi-page views.
 - The project's unique feature, JWT Authentication, guards against hackers accessing your personal information.
